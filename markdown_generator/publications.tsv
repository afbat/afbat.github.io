2021-01-15	Building Brand Authenticity on Social Media: The Impact of Instagram Ad Model Genuineness and Trustworthiness on Perceived Brand Authenticity and Consumer Responses	Journal of Interactive Advertising	This study builds on the growing literature of social media and brand authenticity literature through an exploration of the impact of Instagram images’ expressive facial and visual aesthetics on consumers’ evaluation of a source (i.e., model in the image) and brand. The findings showed that a smiling (versus nonsmiling) facial expression and a snapshot (versus studio) photography aesthetic resulted in higher perceived source genuineness. Following the theoretical rationale of the meaning transfer model, our findings further revealed the positive effect of perceived source genuineness on an endorsed brand’s perceived authenticity via mediation of perceived source trustworthiness. Moreover, this positive effect of model genuineness was found to carry over to consumers’ brand attitudes and behavioral intentions.	Yang, J., Teran, C., Battocchio, A.

2020-12-30	Effects of transparent brand communication on perceived brand authenticity and consumer responses	Journal of Product & Brand Management	Purpose: This study aims to understand the effects of brands’ transparent communication (i.e. production transparency and cost transparency) on consumers’ perceptions of a brand’s perceived transparency and authenticity, as well as how such perceptions impact consumers’ attitude, trust and behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Two between-participants factorial design experiments (n = 176 for Study 1 and n = 169 for Study 2) were conducted to examine consumers’ responses to a brand’s cost transparency and production transparency. Findings: The results revealed that transparency in the focal brand’s communication of production and cost would increase consumers’ perceptions of the brand’s transparency and authenticity because of its perceived information sensitivity. Such positive effects were found to similarly impact consumers’ attitude, trust and behavioral intention toward the brand. Practical implications: The results point to the importance of brand transparency in marketing communication, specifically as it pertains to the influence that the inclusion of transparent cost and production information can have on consumers’ perceptions of authenticity, trust and attitude, as well as how these perceptions translate into behavioral intention. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to explore the differences between production transparency and cost transparency in influencing consumer responses and the underlying mechanisms. The findings also expand to the literature on brand transparency and brand authenticity.	Yang, J., & Battocchio, A. F. (2020).
