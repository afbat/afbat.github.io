# About

Hiya! My name is Ava Francesca and I'm an [Information and Media](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/ava-francesca-battocchio) PhD Student in the [Department of Advertising and Public Relations](https://comartsci.msu.edu/departments/advertising-public-relations), under the advisement of Dr. [Kjerstin Thorson](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/kjerstin-thorson)

# Research Interests

# Professional Affiliations and Service

Since 2021, I have been the graduate student lab manager in the [Civic Infrastructure Lab](https://comartsci.msu.edu/civic-infrastructure-lab). I am also an affiliate with the [Rural Computing Research Consortium](https://ruralcomputing.msu.edu/), and as well as a Research Fellow with the [Quello Center](https://quello.msu.edu/).

Outside of Michigan State, I also serve as a graduate student liaison to both the AEJMC History Division and AEJMC Communication Theory and Methods Division.

# Background 

I'm a non-traditional student from a working-class, low-income background. After three attempts at community college, in two states, I earned my associate degree in 2015 from Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 2017, I moved from Duluth, Minnesota to Chicago and was Loyola University Chicago’s School of Communication’s first dual-degree student. I concurrently completed my Bachelor of Arts in Advertising (2019) and Master of Science in Global Strategic Communication (2020) while juggling between two and four jobs. (I would say that my stints as a chandler and a chicken-sitter provided the best perks during this period.) 

Previous creative and activist work includes collaborating with and coordinating distribution for a feminist Zine collective; designing, producing, and managing a size-inclusive, femme vintage reproduction apparel line; and several years, on-call overnight, as a crisis hospital advocate for survivors of sexual violence.

When I’m is not studying, my interests include volunteering as a public history and industrial heritage tour guide(think “grains and trains”), social activism, rail-fanning, biking, alternative print media, sewing, and photography. I also spend a lot of time with 2 sassy geriatric cats and the botanic garden in my house.

I hope to [use my experience to open a discussion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ka0zVE1hCKvHONoYjh5wSmtfcqIdh2cz/view?usp=sharing) about the value of both formal and informal education along with shedding light on why it can be difficult for people without a traditional educational journey to find their way to graduation.
