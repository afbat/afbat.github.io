### Research Projects

#### Human-Centered Infrastructure Design and the Future of Rural Digital Connectivity

I am currently conducting ethnographic research (i.e. interviewing, hanging out, and experiencing the community, observations, etc.) as part of a larger study. This study explores the connectivity experiences and needs of people living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and investigates the localized and often invisible connectivity needs of rural people, and how we might design infrastructure so it better serves rural communities.
