### Hobbies

When I’m is not studying, my interests include volunteering as a public history and industrial heritage tour guide(think “grains and trains”), social activism, rail-fanning, biking, alternative print media, sewing, and photography. I also spend a lot of time with 2 sassy geriatric cats and the botanic garden in my house.

### Public History Lectures

In addition to providing public history tours in Chicago's Edgewater and Albany Park community areas, as well as well as a Transit Tour on the Brown Line, I have given several public lectures:
<br>

**The Chicago Council on Science and Technology (C2ST) “From Here to There: The History and Future of Chicago’s Transportation”**
_Monday May 3rd, 2021 at 6 PM EDT on Facebook Live/YouTube Live_
<br>
How has transit changed over the years? How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the way we use transit? How will emerging technologies allow us to modify and enhance the transit systems we have in place? Join us on a tour of Chicago’s transportation systems both past, present, and future to hear answers to these questions and many more.

**Chicago for Chicagoans "Advertise Judiciously: A History of Advertising in Chicago"**
_June 1, 2020 6:30pm CST via Facebook Live_
<br>
Backburner what you learned on Mad Men, because we are digging into Chicago’s history of “commercial magicians and priests of consumption.” Join Ava Francesca Battocchio as they explore Chicago’s history of advertising, outdoor billboards, and the folks who make (and occasionally break the boundaries) of the industry as we know it.
