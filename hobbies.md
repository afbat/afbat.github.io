### Hobbies

When I’m is not studying, my interests include volunteering as a public history and industrial heritage tour guide(think “grains and trains”), social activism, rail-fanning, biking, alternative print media, sewing, and photography. I also spend a lot of time with 2 sassy geriatric cats and the botanic garden in my house.

### Public History Lectures

In addition to providing public history tours in Chicago's Edgewater and Albany Park community areas, as well as a Transit Tour on the Brown Line, I have given several public lectures:
