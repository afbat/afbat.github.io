### Hobbies

When I’m is not studying, my interests include volunteering as a public history and industrial heritage tour guide(think “grains and trains”), social activism, rail-fanning, biking, alternative print media, sewing, and photography.

I really enjoy tinkering around with computers and programming languages when I'm not using them for work. If given the chance, I will heavily proselytize R while trying to convince you to convert to a Zotero-Rmarkdown/Quarto notetaking workflow and to turn that old MacBook into a dedicated Linux machine (sorry in advance).

I also spend a lot of time in what I call "The Retirement Community" which consists of 2 sassy geriatric cats, nicknamed "The Grandparents", and the botanic garden in my house.


### Public History Lectures

In addition to providing public history tours in Chicago's Edgewater and Albany Park community areas, as well as a Transit Tour on the Brown Line, I have given several public lectures:
