#### Important Note

Some pages may appear upside down in the preview—**this is intentional**. The upside-down pages ensure everything prints correctly when you fold the zine.

#### After Printing

1. Stack the printed pages in order
2. Fold the stack in half
3. Staple along the spine (optional but recommended)

Your zine is ready to read!
