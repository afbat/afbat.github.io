##### Abstract:

We examine the work that U.S. young adults undertake to design and maintain their personal media worlds across digital platforms, and the consequences of those practices for news use. Drawing on 50 in-depth interviews with 18-34-year-olds, including a shared reading of participants’ most-used social media platforms, we develop the concept of personal platform architecture and articulate links between this architectural work and other forms of digital labor. We illustrate the types of labor young platforms users engage in as they construct and curate across multiple “public” and “private” spaces online, with an emphasis on architectural labor that leads away from encounters with news
