##### Abstract:
This essay examines the similarities and differences between the values underpinning Indigenous and Western journalism. It contributes to broader conversations about the conception and study of journalism through three key contributions. Theoretically, it bridges feminist standpoint and Indigenous epistemologies to enrich journalism studies and practice. Conceptually, it offers a typology of universal themes in Indigenous journalism, identifying five key dimensions – values, roles, approaches, narratives, and organizational structures. Practically, this framework points to how Western journalism can adopt lessons from Indigenous practices to address ongoing ethical and professional challenges.
