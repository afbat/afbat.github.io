##### Abstract:

This study explores the types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) messages communicated on social media during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States and its corresponding effects in driving consumer engagement and related psychological responses. Two studies were conducted. In Study 1, we analyzed corporations’ social media posts. We identified and compared four different CSR message types (i.e., employee-relevant CSR, community-relevant CSR, promotional CSR, and company statement) in their effects on consumers’ behavioral engagement. In Study 2, we conducted an online experiment to extend the findings of Study 1 further. Study 1 revealed that employee-relevant CSR received the highest consumer behavioral engagement among all types of CSR messages. Study 2 revealed a mediation effect of consumers’ engagement intention between the CSR message types and consumers’ brand attitudes and trust. In addition, community-relevant CSR and company statements received higher evaluations of brand attitude and brand trust.
