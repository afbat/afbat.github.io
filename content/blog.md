### News and Updates
- **May 2024:**
     AEJMC decision day. This year I was 2/2 with Extended Abstracts getting accepted to Communication Theory and Methods and Community Journalism. I'm super grateful to my co-authors for the opportunity to collaborate with them. I'm also exceptionally proud of the EA going to Community Journalism, which features as second author Brandi Stover, my undergraduate research mentee. It's going to be a busy summer with diss fieldwork, Australia for ICA, and now Philly for AEJMC. Plus, I am officially on the job market for Fall 2025!

- **April 2024:**
    Several major updates since the fall, aside from the fact that I still need a nap. First and most importantly, I defended my dissertation proposal earlier this month ðŸŽ‰. On a similar note, while I was completing my proposal, I submitted 3 different grant applications to fund my mixed ethnographic and computational methods dissertation and was awarded all 3, coming in at a little under $13,000. I'm very grateful to the Department of Advertising + Public Relations, the College of Communication Arts & Sciences and the Charles J. Strosacker Graduate Research Fund for Health and Risk Communication in the Michigan State University College of Communication Arts & Sciences for supporting my dissertation and diss-related work. Other highlights include 3 publications making their way out into the world, lots of exciting progress on the NSF-funded project on volunteer moderators for local groups,and an ICA acceptance, which means I will be headed to Australia in June. Lastly, I'm getting ready to go on the market this summer and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where I land next.

- **October 2023:**
    Busy (but exciting) couple of months-- dissertation proposal writing in full swing, couple of fieldwork trips Up North, started my appointment for the next year as a Research Assistant on a NSF-funded project, had a publication accepted, and have a couple other manuscripts in various stages of getting out the door. Perhaps, more exciting news is that on November 2nd I will be presenting very early findings from over a year of ethnographic fieldwork alongside Jean Hardy, PhD, at the [Merit Network's Michigan Broadband Summit](https://www.merit.edu/community/events/michigan-broadband-summit-2023/#agenda). (And then I will probably take a nap.)

- **July 2023:**
    Outta the Bush and into the books: returned from a week of fieldwork Up North and dove right into the University of Michigan's [Digital Studies Summer Institute](https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/digital-ideas/2023.html). Really excited to spend to spend the next two weeks learning and growing alongside an awesome group of social justice-oriented scholars and practitioners. Additionally, I will join the [Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life](https://citap.unc.edu/) as an affiliate for the 2023-2024 academic year. In sum, lots of opportunities to connect with others doing super rad and important work.

- **June 2023:**
    Had an awesome ICA in Toronto. But I guess the bigger news is that on June 1, I successfully defended my Comprehensive Exams which means I'm now a PhD Candidate ðŸŽ‰ Excited to start working on my dissertation proposal and to head out into the field next week. But first, sleep.
